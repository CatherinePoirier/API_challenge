# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?


Created weather plots  of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

The following plots were created.

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Then Linear Regressions were created for the following:

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

1) For both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres the Maximum Tempature decreases in cities as the location moves further away from the equator.
2) The Humidity in Northern Hemispheres cities slighly increases the further away they are from the equator while in the Southern Hemisphere cities humidity slighly decreases the futher wasy from the equator.
3) The Cloudiness in Northern Hemispheres cities slighly increases the further away they are from the equator while in the Southern Hemisphere cities Cloudiness  slighly decreases the futher wasy from the equator.
4) The Wind Speed in Northern Hemispheres cities stays the same for all location while in the Southern Hemisphere cities Wind Speed  slighly increases the futher wasy from the equator.

The cities information was saved to a cvs file.
